| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Overall Structure                        | 3 - The article contains Title, Authors, Abstract, Introduction, Related Work,Methodology, Experiments and Results, Conclusion, and References. All parts are well balanced. | 2 - Some parts are missing, or the balance is off.           | 1 - The essential structural parts are missing.              |
| Abstract and Title                       | 6 - Title and Abstract briefly describe the motivation, methodology and results and give a good overview of the following content. | 4 - Both are present and somewhat describe the content but lack clarity. | 2 - Title or Abstract do not summarize the article.          |
| Problem statement                        | 6 - The topic is introduced, and the groundwork is laid as to the direction of the article. A research question/hypothesis or goal has been identified. | 4 - Readers are aware of the overall problem, challenge, or topic that is to be examined. | 2 - No reference is made to the topic that is to be examined. |
| Previous Work                            | 3 - The article gives a good overview of what has been done in research that is related to the research question, condensed to the essential parts. Differences to the proposed method or technique and advantages/disadvantages are highlighted. | 2 - The relevant literature is mainly discussed but lacks clarity regarding differences in the methodology or some relevant parts are missing. | 1 - Previous work is not discussed.                          |
| Methodology                              | 9 - The methodology that has been used to test the hypothesis is described in away that the decisions the authors made are understandable, and the reader could easily reproduce the results. | 6 - The methodology has been described, but open questions remain. | 3 - Based on the authors' description, it is unclear what has been done. |
| Experiments and Results                  | 12 - The approach to test the hypothesis is valid and yields meaningful resultsthat are presented (e.g., as statistics or plots) and discussed (and not onlyreported) in an insightful way. | 8 - The approach to test the hypothesis is valid and the results are presented,but not sufficiently discussed (e.g., "the average accuracy of ourclassifier is 90%" instead of why and what that means). | 4 - The approach to test the hypothesis is not valid or results have not been presented and discussed. |
| Conclusion and Future Work               | 9 - The authors briefly summarize problem, proposed solution, discuss why that yields a solution and what would be the drawbacks / next steps in this work. | 6 - The authors provide concluding remarks and future research directions. Some of the conclusions, however, were not supported in the body of the article. | 3 - There is no indication the author tried to synthesize the information or draw a conclusion. |
| Flow of the article                      | 3 - The article goes from general ideas to specific conclusions. Transitions tie sections together, as well as adjacent paragraphs. | 2 - There is a basic flow from one section to the next, but not all sections or paragraphs follow in a natural or logical order. | 1 - The article appears to have no direction, with subtopics appearing disjointed. |
| Clarity of writing and writing technique | 6 - Writing is crisp, clear, and succinct. The writer incorporates the active voice when appropriate. Meaning is explicit. | 4 - Writing is generally clear, but unnecessary words are used. Meaning is sometimes hidden. Paragraph or sentence structure is too repetitive. | 2 - It is hard to know what the writer is trying to express. Misspelled words,incorrect grammar, and improper punctuation make reading difficult. |
| Citations                                | 3 - All needed citations were included in the article. References matched thecitations, and all were encoded in correct format. | 2 - Citations within the body of the article and a corresponding reference list were presented. Some formatting problems exist, or components were missing. | 1 - Citations for statements included in the article were not present, or references which were included were not found in the text. |
